We have added a new API to launch a check with OpenStatus. You can now test your endpoint's latency programmatically.

It's useful if you want to integrate OpenStatus with your CI/CD pipeline.

You can read the [API documentation](https://api.openstatus.dev/v1#tag/monitor/POST/monitor/:id/trigger).
