---

By default, OpenStatus will timeout after `45s` but you can set a custom timeout (max. `45s`).

You can also set a custom degraded threshold. If the response time is higher than the degraded threshold, the status will be set to `Degraded` and we will send a notification.

To change assertions for your monitors: _Select a monitor &rarr; Settings &rarr; Timing & Assertions_.
