title: Follow Redirects
description: "What are follow redirects on a monitor in OpenStatus"
---

The Follow Redirects option controls whether your monitor should automatically follow HTTP redirects. **By default, we follow the redirects.**

When enabled, the monitor will follow any `3xx` redirect responses (e.g. `301 Moved Permanently`, `302 Found`) until it reaches the final destination URL. The monitor will then report the status of the final response.

Enable this option if:
- You are monitoring a URL that often redirects (e.g. from http:// to https://, or from a short link to the final page).
- You want to verify that the final destination is available and returns the expected response.
