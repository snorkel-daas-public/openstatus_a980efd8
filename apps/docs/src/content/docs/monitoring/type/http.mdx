### URL

Enter the URL of your service that you want to monitor. You can also add a path and query parameters to the URL.

### Methods

Following HTTP methods are supported:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `HEAD`

Let us know if you need more methods to support at ping@openstatus.dev.

### Headers

If you need to set custom headers for your HTTP requests, you can do so by going to the `Headers` tab and adding a new header.

### Body Payload

When you select the `POST` method, you can add a body payload to your request. This is useful when you need to send data to your service.

Payloads are often JSON or XML, but we also support plain text or binary files.
