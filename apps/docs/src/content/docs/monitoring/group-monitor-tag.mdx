If you have multiple monitors that you want to group together, you can do so by creating a tag. Tags help you organize your monitors and manage them more efficiently.

### Create a tag

You can create a tag by going to settings tab of your monitor and adding a new tag.

  <Image
    src={createTag}
    alt="OpenStatus create monitor tag"
  />


### Filter monitors by Tags

Once you have created tags, you can filter your monitors by tags. This helps you to quickly find the monitors you are looking for.

  <Image
    src={filterTag}
    alt="OpenStatus filter by tag"
  />
