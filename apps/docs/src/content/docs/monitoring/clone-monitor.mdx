Go to the **Monitors** page, click on three dots and the select the **Clone** button. This will create a new monitor with the same settings as the original monitor (including Status Page, Notifications and Tags).

By default, the cloned monitor will be in the **inactive** state to allow you to review the settings before activating it.
