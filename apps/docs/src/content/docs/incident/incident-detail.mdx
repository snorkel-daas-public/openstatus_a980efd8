On the incident page, you can  see the details of the incident, the monitor that failed, and the duration.
We are also taking a screenshot of the monitor when the incident is created, and when it's resolved.

<Aside>There might be a delay between the incident creation and the screenshot capture. Your endpoint could have already recovered.</Aside>
