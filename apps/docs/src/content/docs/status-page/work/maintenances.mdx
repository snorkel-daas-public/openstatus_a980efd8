You can predefine maintenance periods for your services and inform your users about upcoming and/or current maintenance.

During the maintenance period, the status of your service will be set to `Maintenance`. We will not ping your selected monitors during this time.

To set up maintenance periods for your services: _Select a status page &rarr; Maintenance_.
