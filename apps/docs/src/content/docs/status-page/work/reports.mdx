## What is a Status Page Report?

A status page report is a timeline of status updates that can be shared with your users. It is a great way to keep your users informed about the status of your application, website or service.

Only the update that happened during the last 7 days will be displayed on the main page of your status page.
Otherwise they will be displayed on your status page and under the **Event** tab.

## How to create a Status Page Report?

Go to your **status page** tab, select your status page click on the **Status report**.

When creating a status report, you can map it to a **monitor** or not. This will allow you access the latest reports on your status
page.

If you don't select a monitor, this is useful if you want to inform your users about an incident, a maintenance of a third party provider.

Update your report over time and keep your users informed. Add a new **status**,
**date** and **message** to your report. They will be displayed on a timeline.


### Status update

The status update can be one of the following:

- **Investigating**: You are investigating an issue
- **Identified**: You have identified the issue
- **Monitoring**: You are monitoring the issue
- **Resolved**: The issue has been resolved
