---

Connect your created monitors to your status page to display the current status of your services.

To change monitors for a status page: _Select a status page &rarr; Settings &rarr; Monitors_.

### Values visibility

By default, we share the number of total requests and the number of failed request with the total uptime of the last 45 days. If you want to hide the values, you can do so by toggeling the setting.

{/* TODO: update after OPE-427 */}
To change the visibility of the values: _Select a status page &rarr; Settings &rarr; Advanced_.


### Public monitors

If you want to share all your monitor metrics with your users, you can make your monitor public. This will allow you to display the metrics on your status page.

To make a monitor public: _Select a monitor &rarr; Settings &rarr; Danger &rarr; Toggle Public monitor.

You can see an example of a public monitor at [https://status.openstatus.dev/monitors/1](https://status.openstatus.dev/monitors/1).
