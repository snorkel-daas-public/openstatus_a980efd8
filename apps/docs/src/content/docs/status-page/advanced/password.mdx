You can password protect your status page to restrict access to it.

To change toggle the protection or change password of your status page: _Select a status page &rarr; Settings &rarr; Visibility_.

The password is stored stored unencrypted in our database and can be shared via `password` search param in the URL, e.g. `https://statuspage.openstatus.dev?password=top-secret`. We recommend using a unique password for your status page.
