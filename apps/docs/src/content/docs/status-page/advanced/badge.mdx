You can embed the status page badge on your website or GitHub README to show the
current status of your services.

<a href="https://status.openstatus.dev">
  <img src="https://status.openstatus.dev/badge" />
</a>

Copy the following code and paste it into your website or GitHub README:

```html
<img src="https://YOUR-SLUG.openstatus.dev/badge" />
```

If you want the dark version of the badge, you can use the following URL:

```html
<img src="https://YOUR-SLUG.openstatus.dev/badge?theme=dark" />
```

You can also customize the size of the badge by adding a `size` parameter:

- `sm`
- `md`
- `lg`
- `xl`


```html
<img src="https://YOUR-SLUG.openstatus.dev/badge?theme=dark&size=xl" />
```
